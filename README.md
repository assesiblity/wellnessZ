Sure! Here is a ready-to-use README.md file for your project, based on the details you've shared:

WellnessZ Client Management System
A web application built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, NodeMailer, and Node-Cron for managing clients and coaches in the WellnessZ system. This application allows for scheduling sessions, sending email notifications, and managing client-coach relationships.

Features
Coach Management: Admins can create coaches.
Client Management: Coaches can assign clients and manage their progress.
Session Scheduling: Coaches can schedule sessions with clients and track their progress.
Email Notifications: Sends email notifications when a session is scheduled and a reminder 24 hours before the session.
MongoDB Integration: Stores user and session data in a MongoDB database.
Technologies Used
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building the backend.
Express.js: Web framework for Node.js.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing client and coach data.
Mongoose: Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
NodeMailer: To send email notifications.
Node-Cron: For scheduling reminders 24 hours before a session.
Dotenv: For managing environment variables.
Setup and Installation
Follow the steps below to get the project up and running locally.

1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>
2. Install Dependencies
Ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed. If not, download and install them from Node.js.

Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
This will install all the packages listed in package.json.

3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project with the following content:

bash
Copy code
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name  # Replace with your MongoDB URI
EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-email-password
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
PORT=5000
Replace your-database-name, your-email, and your-email-password with your actual values. If youâ€™re using MongoDB Atlas (cloud-based MongoDB), update the MONGO_URI with the connection string provided by Atlas.

4. Start the Application
To start the application locally, run:

bash
Copy code
node app.js
Or, if you're using nodemon (to automatically restart the server when files change):

bash
Copy code
nodemon app.js
The server will start on http://localhost:5000.

API Routes
1. POST /api/coaches
Purpose: Create a new coach (Admin only).
Request Body:
json
Copy code
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "password": "yourpassword",
  "specialization": "Fitness"
}
Response:
json
Copy code
{
  "message": "Coach created successfully",
  "coach": {
    "_id": "some_unique_id",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "specialization": "Fitness"
  }
}
2. POST /api/clients/:id/schedule
Purpose: Schedule a session for a client.
Request Body:
json
Copy code
{
  "date": "2024-12-01",
  "time": "10:00",
  "sessionType": "Consultation"
}
Response:
json
Copy code
{
  "message": "Session scheduled and email sent."
}
Testing the Application
Use Postman or cURL to test the POST /api/coaches and POST /api/clients/:id/schedule endpoints.
You can test the email functionality by verifying if the emails are sent successfully upon scheduling a session.
Troubleshooting
MongoDB connection errors: Check if the MONGO_URI is correct, and MongoDB is running (either locally or on Atlas).
Email sending issues: Ensure that the email credentials in .env are correct, and your email provider (like Gmail) allows access for less secure apps if needed.
Missing environment variables: If any of the environment variables are missing, the application might fail to start. Make sure .env contains all required variables.
Future Improvements
User Authentication: Add JWT authentication and role-based access control (Admin, Coach).
Performance Optimization: Implement caching for frequent queries like client lists and session schedules.
Client Performance Tracking: Implement a feature to track client progress, such as weight loss or fitness goals.
